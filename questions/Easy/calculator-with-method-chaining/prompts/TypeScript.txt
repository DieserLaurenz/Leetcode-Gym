Solve the following problem in TypeScript. Use the provided template as a starting point.

Template:

class Calculator {
    
    constructor(value: number) {
        
    }
    
    add(value: number): Calculator {
        
    }
    
    subtract(value: number): Calculator {
        
    }
    
    multiply(value: number): Calculator {
        
    }
    
    divide(value: number): Calculator {
        
    }
    
    power(value: number): Calculator {
        
    }
    
    getResult(): number {
        
    }
}

Problem:

Design a Calculator class. The class should provide themathematical operations ofaddition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation. It should also allow consecutive operations to be performed using method chaining.The Calculator class constructor should accept a numberwhich serves as theinitial value of result.
Your Calculatorclass should have the following methods:

add - This method adds the given number value to theresult and returns the updated Calculator.
subtract -This method subtracts the given number valuefrom theresult and returns the updated Calculator.
multiply -This method multiplies the result by the given number value and returns the updated Calculator.
divide -This method divides the result by the given number value and returns the updated Calculator. If the passed value is 0, an error "Division by zero is not allowed" should be thrown.
power -This method raises theresult to the power of the given number value and returns the updated Calculator.
getResult -This method returns the result.

Solutions within10-5of the actual result are considered correct.

Example 1:

Input: 
actions = ["Calculator", "add", "subtract", "getResult"], 
values = [10, 5, 7]
Output: 8
Explanation: 
new Calculator(10).add(5).subtract(7).getResult() // 10 + 5 - 7 = 8

Example 2:

Input: 
actions = ["Calculator", "multiply", "power", "getResult"], 
values = [2, 5, 2]
Output: 100
Explanation: 
new Calculator(2).multiply(5).power(2).getResult() // (2 * 5) ^ 2 = 100

Example 3:

Input: 
actions = ["Calculator", "divide", "getResult"], 
values = [20, 0]
Output: "Division by zero is not allowed"
Explanation: 
new Calculator(20).divide(0).getResult() // 20 / 0 

The error should be thrown because we cannot divide by zero.


Constraints:

actions is a valid JSON array of strings
valuesis a valid JSON array of numbers
2 <= actions.length <= 2 * 104
1 <= values.length <= 2 * 104- 1
actions[i] is one of "Calculator", "add", "subtract", "multiply", "divide", "power", and"getResult"
First action is always "Calculator"
Last action is always "getResult"
