Solve the specified problem within the provided TypeScript function template, without declaring the main function and using only libraries from the standard library. Provide the code without explanation.

Template:

function removeTrailingZeros(num: string): string {

};

Problem:

Given a positive integer num represented as a string, return the integer num without trailing zeros as a string.

Example 1:

Input: num = "51230100"
Output: "512301"
Explanation: Integer "51230100" has 2 trailing zeros, we remove them and return integer "512301".

Example 2:

Input: num = "123"
Output: "123"
Explanation: Integer "123" has no trailing zeros, we return integer "123".


Constraints:

1 <= num.length <= 1000
num consistsof only digits.
num doesn'thave any leading zeros.
